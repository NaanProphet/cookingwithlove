Grate that coconut!
Finely chop onions to go with the amount of coconut (usually ~1/2 or 1/4 of an onion). Red onions are best since they are a little spicier and less sweet.
Cut 2 green chilies very very fine.
Mix all together and squeeze about 1/2 or maybe 1/4 a lemon/lime.
Add salt.

DONE! Extremely easy to prepare and tastes fantastic!
