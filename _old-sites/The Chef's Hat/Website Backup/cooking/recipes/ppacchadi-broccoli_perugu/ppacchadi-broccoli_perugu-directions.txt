Make popu first: aavalu (mostly), jeelakarra (a little less), mentulu (the least, or else too bitter). Note: this is a nayya popu -- do not fry in oil!!
Then add cut broccoli
After about 5-10 minutes, once the broccoli has cooked, add uppu and pasupu for a nice flavor.
Finally, add yogurt and you're DONE!
