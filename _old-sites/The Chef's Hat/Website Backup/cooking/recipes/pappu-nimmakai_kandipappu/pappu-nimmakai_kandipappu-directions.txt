Cook kandipappu (1 cup for 3 people: 2 cups water -- mom always puts a tad more). Before turning on pressure cooker, add about 1 tsp of ghee a pinch pasupu for a nice flavor.
This recipe requires two popus. While pappu is cooking, prepare the first popu: red chilis, mentulu, lots of aavalu, and an ingua block. If ingua block not available, don't worry just skip it! After the popu is done, dancha (i.e. mash/grind)  the first popu.
After pappu has cooked, mix the dancha'ed stuff.
Cut 5 green chilis.
2nd popu (mom likes vegetable oil): Green chilis, and if the ingua block was not available, add ingua powder to this popu.  
Once popu is ready, add karvepaku and then immediately turn off and add to the pappu!!!
Squeeze lemon (1 big/2 small) into pappu.
Add salt to taste.
