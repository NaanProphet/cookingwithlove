Gently dry-roast peanuts in a pan i.e. without oil. A *little* roast is good, but if too much, then the skin needs to be peeled afterwards so there isn't any burnt flavor at the end; the best way to do this is to blow across them in a pan outside!
Grate that coconut! About half. (Best to grate all of the coconut and leave some in the fridge so you can use it again for this, or some other recipe!)
Take some green chilis... (uh-oh)
Grind all of the ABOVE. You will need to add water while grinding; use your judgement as too much will make it too thin!
And ADD the popu to the rest: urad dal, aavalu, curry leaves. Note: do not grind the popu, or else it will taste bitter (because of the curry leaves)!! I only say this because I did this before... =D
Lastly, squeeze a little lime juice or mix a little yogurt (i.e. especially if you didn't remove skin from the peanuts).

P.S. This also tastes great with dosas as well!
