First soak senegapappu in water for 4 hours.
Peel skin off gumidkai, and then cut into small pieces. Remove seeds if necessary.
Popu: 2 tbsns oil; 1tsp minapappu; 1tsp aavalu; 1 red chili
Add cut gumidkai pieces; then add soaked sengapappu; last 1/2 cup water.
Cook on medium flame with lid.
After about 10 minutes, check to see if senegappu is cooked (by mashing). If so, then only add salt and turmeric powder, stir and you're done!
If not cooked yet, add another 1/4 cup water, place lid and check back after 5 minutes.

Tastes great!
