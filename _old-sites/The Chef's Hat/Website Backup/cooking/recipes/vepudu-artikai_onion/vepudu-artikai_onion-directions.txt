Peel artikai skin first (a little skin is okay and adds to the flavor), then cut into bite-size pieces.
In pan with oil (a little generous), fry artikai; mix ~ every 10 mins. Takes ~ 30 mins.
Once artikai is almost cooked, If onions are available, add cut onions to pan. Should turn a nice color after but a few mins.
Then add salt (1/2 tbsp), and jeelakarra podi (3/4 tbsp)
Lastly, add chili powder!
