Cut bendakai into small pieces by cutting away the two ends.
Pour oil in pan and cook bendakai (no popu!).Stir carefully once in between so that it won't become mushy.
After ~ 10-15 min, once cooked -- don't stir (too much) in between! -- then take 1 pearl of garlic per person and grate it very finely on top of the bendakai. Can use more if you like, to taste. Fry without the lid on for another 2 mins and add chili powder and salt to taste.
