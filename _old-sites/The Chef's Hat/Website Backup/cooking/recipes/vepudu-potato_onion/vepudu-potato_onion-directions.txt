No popu! Just oil in pan.
If boiling potatoes, boil, peel, and cut the potatoes (about 15 mins). Add cut onions to pan (red are best for spicy flavor) FIRST and once cooked, add the already cooked potatoes.
If not boiling potatoes, add cut potatoes (probably should be peeled) to the pan FIRST. Once cooked (will take longer than aforementioned method), THEN add cut onions.
If not adding onions, well then I guess you'll be zipping right through!
Once all cooked, add uppu, kaaram and optionally, jeelakarra podi.
