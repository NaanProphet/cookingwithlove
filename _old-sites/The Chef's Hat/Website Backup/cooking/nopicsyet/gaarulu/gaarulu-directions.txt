Soak 2 cups minavulu (minappappu w/ seed cover) overnight. Mom likes to use split minavulu, as the whole doesn't soak the water properly.
Then grind the pappu in wet grinder and add water as appropriate. Too much water will make the pined soak up too much oil; try maybe 1/2 cup of water.
Grind for 10 minutes, wait for 5 and grind again for 10 minutes.
In the meantime cut 3 onions (red is preferable) lengthwise, 7 small green chilis very fine. These will be mixed in with the pindi once ready.
Also take 1 stemful of karvepak, wash the leaves, and tear them in half and add them to the onions and chilis.
Once pindi is ready add the onions, chilis and karvepak with uppu and 1 tsp jeelakarra whole. Mix well!
Now comes the tough part: deep frying them in oil!
Heat the frying pan on high. After about 5-10 minutes the oil will be hot enough. You can tell when it is ready by holding your hand over the pan and by holding your hand over it.
Have a bowl of fresh water ready. Dip your hand in the water and then take a small amount of pined in your hand.
Dip a finger of your other hand in the water and then make a small hole in the pindi.
Carefully lower the pindi in the oil. Flip the sides so that both sides are cooked.
