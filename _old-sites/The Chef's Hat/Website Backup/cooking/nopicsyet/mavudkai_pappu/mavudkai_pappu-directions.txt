Preliminary popu first: aavalu, mental, red chilis, and dhaniyaalu
If using ingua whole, also add in towards the end. If using ingua powder, do nothing now.
Once popu is ready, turn stove off and scoop out the popu so it can be dancha'ed. Leave as much oil as possible.
If using ingua powder, then turn stove again and fry the ingua powder into the second popu; else proceed to next step.
With the stove on, add the soaked peserapappu and add double water to the pot.
After about 10 minutes add the dancha'ed popu, uppu, pasupu, and karvepak.
