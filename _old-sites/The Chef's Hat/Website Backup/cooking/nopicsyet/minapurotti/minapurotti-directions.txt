Pour two tablespoons of oil on pan. It will look like a lot but it's all the oil that will be used.
Then pour two (or three if using a smaller garita) ladlefuls of pindi in the center and then spread around. Do not add oil to the outside like is done with dosas.
Then place lid over the pan and let cook for about 10 minutes.
Then flip and let cook the other side for another 10 minutes.
Done!
