Soak the peserapappu in water for 1-2 hours. The amount of water does not matter, as it will be drained before grinding. Once ready, make the popu: 20-25 red chilis whole (generous!), whole ingua (3-4 pieces) and aavalu (generous again) \U2014 that's all!Then in a mixer, place then popu, and then the cut mango. Blend 'em! (One way of proceeding: Grind in installments so that way you can you mix them together later, especially if the blender is not that big. It's not a big deal\U2014just grind everything!!!) Also add to 1-1.5 tbsp salt, and a little bit of pasupu while grinding. Note: No need to add water, the mangos have it all! Mix it all together and you're done!

P.S. These are the exact same steps for peserapappu pacchadi without mango, but minus the mango! (You might need to add only a touch of water if grinding without mangos. Not too much, or else it will be watery!)
