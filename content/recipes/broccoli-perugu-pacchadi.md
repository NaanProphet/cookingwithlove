## Ingredients

*   broccoli, cut
*   aavalu (mustard seeds)
*   jeelakarra (cumin seeds)
*   mentulu (fenugreek seeds)
*   pasupu (turmeric powder)
*   uppu (salt)
*   nayya (for popu)

## Directions

Make popu first: aavalu (mostly), jeelakarra (a little less), mentulu (the least, or else too bitter). Use nayya (ghee) for popu and not oil, since this will mix with another dairy product (yogurt).

Then add cut broccoli, uppu and pasupu. Cook for 5-10 minutes.

After cooked, let cool for a few minutes.

Finally, add yogurt and you're DONE!
