## Ingredients

*   1 cup sprouted moong dal
*   1 cup sprouted matki dal
*   1.5 cup raw quinoa
*   ginger
*   cumin seeds
*   salt
*   turmeric

## Directions

Lightly dry roast quinoa in a pan until it pops.

Then, for popu: ginger and cumin seeds. Make popu in the rice cooker itself (not non-stick). This will help the rice at the bottom not get burnt and otherwise cause the cooker to turn off before all is cooked.

Add dal, quinoa, salt and turmeric to taste and 4 cups of water to rice cooker.

Done!
