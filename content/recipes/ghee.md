## Ingredients

*   Unsalted butter

## Directions

1. Let butter sit in room temperature for 2 hours.
2. Ensure pan wide enough and level. Otherwise portions may cook faster than others.
3. Medium flame, start to melt butter.
4. Wait for bubbles to form, do not stir.
5. When the outside edge has very slight golden-brown bubbles, turn the stove off. It will still cook from residual heat for another 10 minutes.
6. Let cool and strain.
