## Ingredients
*   Erra merpkayulu (dried red chilis)
*   Aavalu (mustard seeds)
*   Minapappu (urad dal)
*   Anapkai (green squash, aka "cabalash")
*   Nuvulu (sesame seeds)

## Directions

1. Dry roast nuvulu and red chilis in a pan with no oil. Sesame seeds should turn golden brown and have a nice aroma. Then grind both in a mixer. This prepares the nuvulu podi used at the end.
2. Very simple popu: aavalu, and minapappu!
3. Peel the anapkai skin and cut into small pieces. Then add the cut anapkai. (Skin can be saved if fresh to make pacchadi afterwards!)
4. Anapkai will turn soft and have a nice smell to them once cooked.
5. Then add nuvulu podi prepared at the beginning and salt!
