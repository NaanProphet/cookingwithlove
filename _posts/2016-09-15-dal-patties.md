Prep time:
Cook time:
Difficulty:

If soaking, soak overnight. The 1/2 cup will then be equivalent to 1 cup. Otherwise use 1 cup of frozen. Note: sometimes the hard black eyed peas are not as tender as the frozen ones.

Finely chop onion and parsley.

Coarsely blend in food processor beans and parsley. Onions should not be blended.

Cook patties on low heat. Can cook multiple at a time. Flip after 10 minutes. Then wait for another 10 minutes.

Goes well in sandwiches.
