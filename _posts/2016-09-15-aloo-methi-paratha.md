Prep time:
Cook time:
Difficulty:

Cook potatoes. If using a pressure cooker, up to 1 whistle; if using a regular pot with water, place lid and cook on high for 30 minutes. Let cool afterwards and peel.

Blend half bunch methi, 4 garlic pearls, 3 green chilis. Best to use a food processor since it should be coarse. Otherwise, will not work in paratha well.

Lightly fry cut methi paste in 1 tsp oil for 1-2 mins.

Place  peeled potatoes and methi paste in bowl. Add 1 tbsp of paratha masala, and 1/3-1/2 tbsp of salt (since the masala usually contains salt) and mash away.
